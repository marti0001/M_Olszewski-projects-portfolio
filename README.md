## Projects

### Project 1: MNIST

**Description:** This project focuses on image classification using the MNIST dataset, which contains handwritten digits. The objective was to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify digits from 0 to 9.

- **Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Objective:** Achieve high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.
- **Results:** Achieved over 99,9% accuracy on the test dataset. I took 34th place in the competition on the kaggle website

### Project 2: Spaceship Titanic

**Description:** This project aims to predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension in the fictional Spaceship Titanic dataset. The problem is approached as a binary classification task.

- **Tools:** Scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Objective:** Develop a model to classify passenger survival based on available features.
- **Results:** Achieved 0.61959 accuracy in prediction.

### Project 3: Titanic

**Description:** A classic data science project using the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. This project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning for binary classification.

- **Tools:** Scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Objective:** Predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
- **Results:** Achieved 0.83839 accuracy on the test set.

### Project 4: Emotion Model

**Description:** This project focuses on image classification using transfer learning with the pre-trained InceptionV3 model. The objective was to effectively classify images into multiple categories, leveraging transfer learning to achieve high accuracy while optimizing computational resources.

- **Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
- **Objective:** I created a convolution neural network (CNN) and utilized transfer learning to classify images efficiently and accurately into predefined categories. The models used include VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3.
- **Results:** Achieved over X% accuracy on the test dataset. The model demonstrates robust performance and generalization on test data.
