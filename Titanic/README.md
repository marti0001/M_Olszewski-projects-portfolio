# Titanic Data Analysis


### Overview
This project contains an analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset, focusing on understanding the factors that influenced passenger survival and building a predictive model. The project uses data exploration, visualization, and machine learning to achieve these objectives.



### Project Description
The Titanic dataset is a classic resource for exploring machine learning workflows. This project includes:

Data cleaning and preparation.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
- Predictive modeling with machine learning techniques.
- Evaluation of model performance.
  
The objective is to predict the survival status of Titanic passengers based on features such as age, gender, class, and more.

### Features
- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values in the dataset.
- Visualization of key patterns and relationships in the data.
- Predictive modeling using algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees.
- Use of advanced models:
    - XGBoost
    - LightGBM
    - CatBoost
- Use of RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model.
- Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy.

### Project Status
The project is not complete, and further updates are planned.
