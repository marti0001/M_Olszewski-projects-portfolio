# MNIST_2_Kaggle_Competition

## Project Description
This project was created to participate in a Kaggle competition focused on classifying MNIST data. The primary objective was to use a pre-trained model to predict results on the test set provided by Kaggle and save the results in the required CSV format.

## The project includes:
- Loading a pre-trained model.
- Fetching and loading competition data from Kaggle.
- Preprocessing input data and preparing it for predictions.
- Generating predictions using the loaded model.
- Exporting results in the Kaggle-required CSV format.
- Drawing conclusions from the results, highlighting that the model achieved an accuracy of 0.99900, which ranked the project at 33rd place on Kaggle.


# MNIST_3_Digit_Recognition

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the practical application of a model trained on MNIST data. The main objective was to test how well the model performs predictions on custom input data, such as manually drawn digits.

## The project includes:
- Loading a pre-trained MNIST model.
- Loading and processing data, including test set images.
- Example of loading and preparing a manually drawn digit image.
- Predicting the digit class from the processed image.
- Conclusions showing that the model works correctly, proving its practical usability.

##Features
- Model Loading: Importing a pre-trained MNIST model.
- Image Processing: Example of transforming an image (e.g., resizing, scaling pixel values).
- Prediction: Predicting the digit class based on a provided image.
- Practical Test: Loading a manually drawn digit image and classifying it using the model.
